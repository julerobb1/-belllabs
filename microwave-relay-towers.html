            <h2>Microwave Relay Towers: The Backbone of Long Lines</h2>
            <p>AT&T's Long Lines microwave relay network was an engineering marvel that revolutionized telecommunications in the mid-20th century. Between the 1950s and 1980s, these iconic towers formed an intricate web across the United States, carrying telephone calls, television broadcasts, and data transmissions coast to coast.</p>
            
            <p>Before fiber optics and satellites became dominant, these towers formed the primary long-distance communications backbone of America, standing as silent sentinels on hilltops, mountains, and buildings across the landscape.</p>

        <section id="design" class="section">
            <h2>Tower Design and Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>The typical AT&T Long Lines tower was a marvel of engineering precision. Most towers were self-supporting structures rising 50 to 200 feet in height, though some reached over 300 feet. They were designed to withstand severe weather conditions while maintaining perfect alignment of their microwave horn antennas.</p>

                <div class="spec-item">
                    <h3>Horn Reflectors</h3>
                    <p>The distinctive feature of many Long Lines towers was the horn-reflector antennas. These large, horn-shaped devices (often called "sugar scoops") were precisely engineered to collect and focus microwave signals. Their unique design minimized signal loss and interference.</p>

                <div class="spec-item">
                    <h3>Tower Spacing</h3>
                    <p>Towers were typically spaced 25-30 miles apart, creating a line-of-sight network. The exact spacing depended on terrain, with shorter distances in mountainous areas and longer spans in flat regions.</p>

                <div class="spec-item">
                    <h3>Equipment Buildings</h3>
                    <p>Each tower site included a building that housed critical equipment: waveguides, repeaters, multiplexers, power systems, and backup generators. These buildings were designed to maintain strict environmental controls to protect sensitive electronics.</p>

                <div class="spec-item">
                    <h3>Frequency Bands</h3>
                    <p>The microwave network operated primarily in the 4, 6, and 11 GHz bands. Each tower could handle multiple channels, with later systems capable of carrying thousands of telephone calls simultaneously.</p>

            <h2>The Nationwide Network</h2>
            <p>At its peak in the 1970s and early 1980s, AT&T's Long Lines microwave network consisted of over 800 towers spanning approximately 70,000 route miles across the United States. This network carried up to 80% of all long-distance telephone traffic in the country, plus television network feeds and early data services.</p>
            
            <p>Major routes included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The L3I Route</strong> - The first transcontinental microwave route, completed in 1951</li>
                <li><strong>The Southern Transcontinental Route</strong> - Spanning the southern states from California to Florida</li>
                <li><strong>The Northern Transcontinental Route</strong> - Connecting the northern states despite challenging winter conditions</li>
                <li><strong>Regional Networks</strong> - Dozens of shorter routes connecting metropolitan areas and rural communities</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Signal Technology</h2>
            <p>The technological innovation behind the microwave relay system was remarkable for its era:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TD Radio Systems</strong> - Time Division multiplexed radio systems allowed multiple signals to share the same frequency by allocating different time slots</li>
                <li><strong>Waveguides</strong> - Special conduits that guided microwaves from the equipment building to the antennas with minimal loss</li>
                <li><strong>Heterodyne Repeaters</strong> - These systems amplified incoming signals without fully demodulating them, reducing noise and distortion over long chains</li>
                <li><strong>Protection Switching</strong> - Automatic systems that could detect fading or equipment failures and switch to backup channels within milliseconds</li>
                <li><strong>Hot Standby</strong> - Critical routes used 1+1 redundancy with backup transmitters and receivers ready to take over instantly</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Legacy and Preservation</h2>
            <p>The microwave network began its decline in the 1980s as fiber optic cables offered greater capacity and reliability. By the late 1990s, most of the system had been decommissioned, with towers sold, repurposed, or dismantled.</p>
            
            <p>Today, some towers remain as historic landmarks or have been repurposed for cellular and other communications. Preservation efforts seek to document and maintain key sites that represent this important chapter in telecommunications history.</p>
            
            <p>Organizations like the AT&T Long Lines & Bell Labs Community work to preserve the technical knowledge, photographs, and stories of this remarkable network before they are lost to time.</p>
