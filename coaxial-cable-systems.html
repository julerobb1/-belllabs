            <h2>Coaxial Cable Systems: The Underground Backbone</h2>
            <p>While AT&T's microwave towers were visible across the American landscape, equally important was the vast network of underground and undersea coaxial cables that formed a critical part of the Long Lines system. These cables provided reliable, high-capacity connections, especially in areas where microwave transmission was impractical or as backup for critical routes.</p>
            
            <p>Coaxial cables revolutionized telecommunications by dramatically increasing capacity compared to traditional copper wire pairs. A single coaxial cable could carry thousands of simultaneous telephone conversations, transforming long-distance communication capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Coaxial Cable Technology</h2>
            <p>AT&T and Bell Labs pioneered coaxial cable technology for telecommunications, developing increasingly sophisticated systems over decades.</p>

            <p>The basic structure of a coaxial cable includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Center Conductor</strong> - Usually copper, carrying the signal</li>
                <li><strong>Dielectric Insulator</strong> - Separating the center conductor from the shield</li>
                <li><strong>Metallic Shield</strong> - Typically copper or aluminum, preventing signal leakage and interference</li>
                <li><strong>Protective Jacket</strong> - Outer covering protecting against environmental factors</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Long Lines coaxial cables were typically bundled in groups of multiple tubes within a protective sheath, with additional layers for underground or undersea installation. Some of the largest cables contained up to 22 separate coaxial tubes plus numerous copper pairs for maintenance and control functions.</p>

            <h2>Undersea Coaxial Cables</h2>
            <p>AT&T laid numerous undersea coaxial cables, connecting continents and enabling international telecommunications:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TAT-1 (1956)</strong> - The first transatlantic telephone cable, connecting Newfoundland to Scotland, carrying 36 voice channels</li>
                <li><strong>TAT-2 (1959)</strong> - Connected France and Newfoundland with 48 voice circuits</li>
                <li><strong>TAT-3 (1963)</strong> - New Jersey to England, with 138 voice channels</li>
                <li><strong>TAT-4 (1965)</strong> - New Jersey to France, also with 138 channels</li>
                <li><strong>TAT-5 (1970)</strong> - Rhode Island to Spain, expanded to 845 voice channels</li>
                <li><strong>TAT-6 (1976)</strong> - Rhode Island to France, a major upgrade to 4,000 voice channels</li>
                <li><strong>TAT-7 (1983)</strong> - New Jersey to England, also with 4,000 channels, the last AT&T analog coaxial transatlantic cable</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These undersea cables required specialized repeaters designed to operate reliably at ocean depths for decades without maintenance. Bell Labs engineers developed hermetically sealed, pressure-resistant housings that became marvels of reliability engineering.</p>

        <section id="infrastructure" class="section">
            <h2>Cable Route Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>The construction and maintenance of coaxial cable routes required extensive infrastructure:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Repeater Stations</strong> - Built every 4-8 miles along routes to amplify signals, these facilities housed equipment, power supplies, and often emergency generators</li>
                <li><strong>Test Stations</strong> - Strategically placed locations where technicians could monitor and test cable performance</li>
                <li><strong>Cable Protection</strong> - Underground cables were placed in conduits, directly buried, or armored depending on terrain and environmental factors</li>
                <li><strong>Right-of-Way Management</strong> - AT&T maintained thousands of miles of cable right-of-way, often alongside railroads, highways, or power lines</li>
                <li><strong>Cable Pressurization</strong> - Many cables were kept under positive air pressure to prevent water intrusion if the outer sheath was damaged</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="legacy" class="section">
            <h2>Legacy and Historical Significance</h2>
            <p>The coaxial cable network represented a critical transition technology between the early open-wire systems and modern fiber optic networks. At its peak in the 1970s, AT&T operated over 65,000 miles of coaxial cable routes across North America.</p>
            
            <p>Though most of these systems have been decommissioned or replaced with fiber optics, their legacy lives on in several ways:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Many of today's fiber optic cables follow the same rights-of-way established for coaxial systems</li>
                <li>The multiplexing technologies developed for coaxial cables influenced modern digital transmission systems</li>
                <li>Repeater building designs and infrastructure practices established during the coaxial era still influence telecommunications facility design</li>
                <li>Several former coaxial cable routes and facilities have been preserved as historical sites</li>
            </ul>
