                    <h2>Claude Shannon (1916-2001)</h2>
                    <h3>Father of Information Theory</h3>
                    <p>Claude Shannon's groundbreaking 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" established the field of information theory and laid the groundwork for modern digital communications and computing.</p>
                    <p>His work quantified the concept of information and introduced the bit as a unit of measurement. Shannon's theories on data compression, noise, and error correction remain fundamental to today's information age.</p>

                    <p>The only person to win the Nobel Prize in Physics twice, John Bardeen co-invented the transistor at Bell Labs with Walter Brattain and William Shockley in 1947.</p>
                    <p>This invention revolutionized electronics and computing, making possible the information age as we know it today. Bardeen later won a second Nobel Prize for his work on superconductivity.</p>

                    <p>Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language and, with Ken Thompson, developed the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs in the early 1970s.</p>
                    <p>C became one of the most influential programming languages in history, while UNIX established design principles that continue to shape modern operating systems including Linux, macOS, and Android.</p>
